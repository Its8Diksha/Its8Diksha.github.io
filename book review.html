      <h2>The 5 AM Club</h2>
      <p class="author">By Robin Sharma</p>
      <p class="date">4 December 2018</p>
      <p class="rating">Rating: 4/5</p>
      <div class="content">
        <p>Legendary leadership and elite performance expert Robin Sharma introduced The 5am Club concept over twenty years ago, based on a revolutionary morning routine that has helped his clients maximize their productivity, activate their best health and bulletproof their serenity in this age of overwhelming complexity...
             Seeing the title of the book, few might be feeling the book will contain a set of rules or tactics which you can practice or teach yourself to wake up at 5 AM. But it’s not TRUE.

It’s a fiction story of 4 main characters.

Characters age-wise (Max to min)

Spellbinder
Billionaire Mr. Riley
Male Artist (A professional painter)
Women Entrepreneur
The story begins with the entrepreneur character who lost most of her shares and she is so close to the situation where she is going to be fired by the company she started. Begin in such a situation she goes to depression and will try to commit suicide.

That’s when she finds the entry pass for the life-changing event by Spellbinder as the entry pass placed on the table by entrepreneur mother. She feels to give it a try.

In the Spellbinder seminar hall, she meets the Artist who love to paint but miss his focus multiple times in his life. While Spellbinder was giving the speech on how to get control of your life, he will falls down.

Entrepreneur and Artist feel bad about Spellbinder, While they about to leave the seminar hall, they will meet Mr. Riley (Billionaire). Three of them will start discussing Spellbinder speech. While leaving the seminar hall, Mr. Riley offers both Entrepreneur and Artist to join him at the same place the next day at 5:00 AM. So he will teach on how to own the early morning and elevate our lives.

From the next day, the main story begins.

The main story is all about how the Entrepreneur and Artist followed the tactics explained by Billionaire and how their life changed afterward.

Finally, the book ends with, what happened to these main four characters after five years (been in 5 AM club).</p>

      <h2>The Power of Your Subconscious Mind</h2>
      <p class="author">By Joseph Murphy</p>
      <p class="date">1963</p>
      <p class="rating">Rating: 5/5</p>
      <div class="content">
        <p>As the title of the book suggests, it promises to be an insightful look into powers beyond the scope of our daily prowess. There is a lot of information imparted in the book, which is divided into sections, and the theories grow in their complexity as you near the end. It’s easy to follow the examples stated in the book that act as vivid similes to break down complex statements. 

At times, it can also be read like a self-help book for those who lack the motivation to push through their defenses and will their thoughts into actions. That makes total sense because we can be one of the biggest obstacles in our path due to personal prejudices whether we like to address them or not. This is not a new book, in fact, it first hit bookshelves back in 1963 but the wisdom holds true even six decades later. </p>

      <h2>Think Like a Monk</h2>
      <p class="author">By Jay Shetty</p>

      <div class="content">
        <p>The Sunday Times Number One Bestseller Jay Shetty, social media superstar and host of the #1 podcast ‘On Purpose’, distils the timeless wisdom he learned as a practising monk into practical steps anyone can take every day to live a less anxious, more meaningful life. ...
          This book was inspiring. It gives you tools and exercises to help you navigate your purpose and healing, without making you feel guilty or afraid that you’re not ready to do those things yet. Unlike most self-help books, Shetty does a brilliant job of balancing his life anecdotes with teaching tools you can choose to use or just learn. The book is both practical and deeply meaningful. I would recommend it for your self-love journey as you continue to find that lovely life you’re looking for.</p>

      <h2>The Monk Who Sold His Ferrari</h2>
      <p class="author">By Robin Sharma</p>

      <p class="rating">Rating: 4.5/5</p>
      <div class="content">
        <p>The Monk Who Sold His Ferrari is a self-help book by Robin Sharma, a writer and motivational speaker. The book is a business fable derived from Sharma's personal experiences after leaving his career as a litigation lawyer at the age of 25.
          The book is like a fable about a highly successful attorney named Julian Mantle. He was delusory about success and was never satisfied. He had every material possession anyone could desire, but he was yet to find his real purpose in life. 

His marriage failed because of his unsatisfying endeavor, he no longer spoke with his father, and he appeared to be in his late seventies at fifty-three. The story’s narrative is from the perspective of one of his associates, John, who admires Mantle’s accomplishments and strives to emulate him.

However, his desire for material possessions faded after he survived a severe heart attack. His outlook on life shifted, and he sold all of his possessions. He abandoned his mundane life and traveled to India for a meaningful experience.

He met sages in the Himalayas who helped him completely transform his life with their knowledge. He returned to share his knowledge, as he had promised the sages of India. He began sharing the blissful knowledge he had received from Indian gurus.</p>
